# Hey!

I'm Osmond Lee, a Chicagoan attending the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign! My major is computer science, with a minor in Game Studies and Design. 

(I would put a banner here but it didn't work so 🤷‍♂️)

My first journey in tech started with the humble Nintendo Wii, and a lot of my earliest years were spent playing Lego Batman. From there, I fell in love with games and the devices we play them on, and while I don't know a whole lot right now, I'm always learning new things! 

### Some of my passions right now include

- 🎮 Game Development 🎮
- 🏆 Valorant Competitive E-Sports 🏆
- 🥢 Cooking Food 🥢
- 💭 Game Design Psychology 💭
